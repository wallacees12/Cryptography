message_2: Sherlock Holmes preserved his calm professional manner until our visitor
had left us, although it was easy for me, who knew him so well, to see that he was
profoundly excited. The moment that Hilton Cubitt’s broad back had disappeared through
the door my comrade rushed to the table, laid out all the slips of paper containing
dancing men in front of him, and threw himself into an intricate and elaborate
calculation. For two hours I watched him as he covered sheet after sheet of paper
with figures and letters, so completely absorbed in his task that he had evidently forgotten my presence. Sometimes he was making progress and whistled and sang at his work; sometimes he was puzzled, and would sit for long spells with a furrowed brow and a vacant eye. Finally he sprang from his chair with a cry of satisfaction, and walked up and down the room rubbing his hands together. Then he wrote a long telegram upon a cable form. “If my answer to this is as I hope, you will have a
very pretty case to add to your collection, Watson,” said he. “I expect that we
shall be able to go down to Norfolk to-morrow, and to take our friend some very
definite news as to the secret of his annoyance.”

I confess that I was filled with curiosity, but I was aware that Holmes liked to make
his disclosures at his own time and in his own way; so I waited until it should suit
him to take me into his confidence.

But there was a delay in that answering telegram, and two days of impatience followed,
during which Holmes pricked up his ears at every ring of the bell. On the evening of
the second there came a letter from Hilton Cubitt. All was quiet with him, save that
a long inscription had appeared that morning upon the pedestal of the sun-dial.
He inclosed a copy of it, which is here reproduced:—
several stick figures in dancing poses

Holmes bent over this grotesque frieze for some minutes, and then suddenly sprang
to his feet with an exclamation of surprise and dismay. His face was haggard with anxiety.

les yeux pour fixer le kaléidoscope de l'obscurité, de goûter grâce à une lueur
momentanée de conscience le sommeil où étaient plongés les meubles, la chambre,
le tout dont je n'étais qu'une petite partie et à l'insensibilité duquel je retournais
vite m'unir
